Hello there!
I'm Shameer. A freshman at FAST NUCES in Computer Science.
My core subjects are:
    - Calculus
    - Programming Fundamentals
    - Applied Physics
    - Ideology and Constitution of Pakistan
    - Islamic Studies
    - Functional English
I have been programming since I was 11 years old, trying to guide myself through code blocks.
I started with python, and have been passionately learning about data science and analytics.
In the future, I would like to pursue Quantitative Finance, or some sort of Business Consultancy.
